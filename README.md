// HW Assignment #2
Asssignment #2. Decided to work on the Assignment over the holiday weekend but came down with a cold + bad allergies and took many days to rest.
I wanted to try and put my best effort into completing the assignment but due to constraints of hardware and limited use of Virtual Macs on school
it was very difficult. 

I took extra time to go over everything and try to make it work however I was not successful in my completion of this assigment. I wanted to get it
done before class on Tuesday. I apologize for the inconvieniece this may cause.
